The Covid-19 data, which was divided into two datasets—Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations—was used in this study. It focuses on using SQL for exploratory data analysis and querying. From February 2020 to May 2022, it contains Covid records. This project's goal is to learn more about and gain understanding of Covid-19's global impact.
